# Publish _out/debs/{amd64,arm64}/pool of a clean HEAD for the published GitHub
# Release <tag> of this repository (mica:docs/design/release-lock.md):
#   - the one mica-podman archive of each pool passes `mica-tools pool guard`
#     against the previous release: a package at a released version keeps its
#     inputs hash and its bytes, and no version goes lower;
#   - `mica-tools release pool` pushes ghcr.io/micaoss/mica-podman:pool.<arch>.<tag>
#     and reads them back anonymously;
#   - the lock (release, pool and package rows) passes `mica-tools lock check`,
#     and `mica-tools release attach` attaches it and SHA256SUMS listing only it,
#     read back anonymously.
# Nothing published is ever replaced.
