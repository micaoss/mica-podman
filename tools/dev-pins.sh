# The Debian packages the engine stages link against, pinned by sha256 instead
# of installed from a live archive
# (mica:docs/decisions/2026-09-15-package-versions.md; the shape mica-system-base
# uses for its own build closures). Each stage of the engine Dockerfile declares
# its roots in pins/<stage>.roots; this resolves their closure against the
# mica-build-env image that stage builds FROM, writes one `source` row per
# archive in locks/upstream.lock and the names of each stage's closure in
# pins/<stage>.<arch>. The build installs those archives with dpkg.
#
#   bash tools/dev-pins.sh check                   the rows still belong to the pinned build-env images (offline)
#   bash tools/dev-pins.sh resolve                 re-resolve every stage and architecture (network, docker)
#   bash tools/dev-pins.sh shas <stage> <arch>     the sha256 of that closure, in install order
#   bash tools/dev-pins.sh fetch <arch> <dir>      every archive of that architecture into <dir>/<sha256>.deb
#
# The closure is what the image lacks, so it is valid for one mica-build-env
# release: pins/resolved-for records the release and the image digests it was
# resolved against, and `check` refuses a build whose build-env lock names
# others. Moving to another build-env release re-resolves it.
